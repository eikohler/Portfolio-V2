# Portfolio 
- I was tasked with using the React Javascript framework to build a portfolio page of my projects
- I created a few components to layout the page: Navigation, About, Contact, Portfolio, Resume, etc.
- The app is a SPA which switches between the components using the nav links
- As well the app has links to everything referenced and a footer with my personal Github and linkedin
